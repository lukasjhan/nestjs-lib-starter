## Features

- ðŸš€ Pre-configured NestJS environment
- ðŸ“¦ Ready-to-use build setup
- ðŸ§ª Testing infrastructure in place
- ðŸ“š Easy-to-follow project structure
- ðŸ›  Development tools and scripts included

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or create repository from this template:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lukasjhan/nestjs-lib-starter your-library-name
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-library-name
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Project Structure

```
nestjs-lib-starter/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # Main entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...             # Your library code goes here
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...             # Test files
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Development

### Writing Your Library Code

1. Place your library code in the `src/` directory.
2. Update `src/index.ts` to export your library's public API.

### Building the Library

To build your library, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile your TypeScript code and generate output in the `dist/` directory.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

This will execute all tests in the `test/` directory using Jest.

## Publishing Your Library

1. Update `package.json` with your library's information (name, version, description, etc.).
2. Build your library: `npm run build`
3. Publish to npm: `npm publish`

## Scripts

- `npm run build`: Builds the library
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Lints the code
